## What is this?

We are creating a map that displays London Underground routes with animations, allowing the user to choose departure and arrival stations.

We are using Leaflet.js & D3 to animate the maps, and to calculate the journey we are using the TFL API.

We plan to make updates to the UI, so that each line is represented by its colour and each stop will have a pop-up as the train passes through it.

We use travis, Istanbul and tape for C-I and coverage testing, for the front end we used Qunit.
